This project was done in the group and we had to implement the ASIC Binary Phase key decoder. My task was to design the costas loop and match filter. The costas loop contained two filter filters, the coefficient was provided to us by the professor. I had used a shift register to implement the FIR filters. The upcoming wave would get multiplied by the output of the NCO (Numerically Controlled Oscillator). The NCO was implemented using an accumulator. The accumulator input was multiplication of sine and cosine filtered waveforms. 

After implementing the costas loop, to detect the synchronization, I had designed the match filter. The upcoming cosine filter output was added continuously for 500 samples. And their addition was compared against the threshold value. If the addition was outside of threshold range, it would detect the sync signal. Once the sync has happened, I would collect the upcoming 250 samples as the sampling rate was supposed to be 2.5 bit/cycle. After collecting the 250 samples, I had done concatenation of 10 bits from the given 250 bits. And that 10 bits would be sent to the decoder.
